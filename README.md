# Screw Type Detection Using ESP-EYE and TensorFlow Lite Micro

This project focuses on using the ESP-EYE and a computer vision algorithm running TensorFlow Lite Micro to detect different types of screws: "Big," "Medium," and "Black." The project consists of two main parts:

1. Data Collection and Model Training
2. Model Deployment on ESP32

## 1. Setup the Development Environment
### Install the ESP-IDF

Follow the [ESP-IDF Get Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html) to set up the toolchain and install the ESP-IDF framework.

## 2. Data Collection and Model Training
### Data Collection

Navigate to the `data_collector` folder. Here’s an overview of its structure:

```shell
data_collector/
├── datasets/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── labels/
│   ├── quant_test_model.py
│   ├── split_dataset.py
│   └── utils.py
├── esp32/
│   ├── build/
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   ├── main/
│   ├── sdkconfig
│   └── sdkconfig.old
├── labels.txt
└── webserver/
    ├── capture.py
    ├── static/
    ├── templates/
    ├── uploader.py
    └── webserver.py
```

### Flashing the ESP32

1. Navigate to the `esp32` directory, activate the ESP32 virtual environment, and clean the build directory:

```bash
cd esp32/
get_idf
idf.py fullclean
```

2. Set up your Wi-Fi credentials by running:

```bash
idf.py menuconfig
```

Navigate to **Example Connection Configuration** and input your Wi-Fi SSID and password.

3. Build and flash the application to the ESP32:

```bash
idf.py build
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 monitor
```

After flashing, the ESP32’s IP address will be displayed. This IP address will be used to access the web server.

```bash
I (4180) WIFI_MODULE: got ip:X.X.X.X
I (4184) WIFI_MODULE: connected to ap <CONFIGURED_SSID> password:<CONFIGURED_PASSWORD>
```

### Running the Web Server

The web server receives images from the ESP32 and stores them in the uploads folder. To start the web server:

1. Set the ESP32’s IP address as an environment variable:

```bash
export ESP32_SERVER_URL=http://<ESP32_IP>:81
```

2. Start the web server:

```bash
cd webserver/
python3 webserver.py
```

3. In a new terminal, start capturing images:

```bash
python3 capture.py
```

Captured images will be saved in the `static/uploads` directory.

### Labeling the Data

1. Use [makesense.ai](https://www.makesense.ai/) for labeling the collected images.
2. Upload the images from the `webserver/static/uploads/` directory to the platform.
3. Load the labels from `labels.txt` and begin labeling your images.
The labels should be "Big," "Medium," and "Black." and the images should be labeled accordingly. The interface should look like this:

![Interface](readme_extras/labeling_makesense.png)

4. After labeling, export the annotations in YOLO format. The files should follow the format `XXX.txt`, where XXX corresponds to the image number.

If you are not familiar with the YOLO format, here is an example of the format for a file named `000.txt`:

```bash
0 0.509715 0.331606 0.190415 0.272021
1 0.591321 0.654793 0.107513 0.224093
```

The first number is the **label**, and the next four numbers are the bounding box coordinates in the format `x_center y_center width height`, scaled to the image size. 

For example, if the image size is 640x480, the bounding box 

```bash
0.509715 0.331606 0.190415 0.272021
```

 would be 
```bash
x_center=0.509715*640=326.29 
y_center=0.331606*480=159.14 
width=0.190415*640=121.86 
height=0.272021*480=130.57
```

### Dataset Preparation

To split the labeled dataset into training and testing sets:

1. Move the labeled images and annotation files into the appropriate directories:

```bash
cd datasets/
rm -rf images labels
mkdir images labels
mv <path_to_labels_zip_file> labels/
cp ../webserver/static/uploads/* images/
```

2. Split the dataset:

```bash
python3 split_dataset.py
```

## 3. Model Deployment on ESP32

Once your model is trained, deploy it to the ESP32 by integrating it into the esp32 directory’s codebase. Follow the instructions provided in the ESP-IDF documentation for deploying TensorFlow Lite Micro models on the ESP32.
